 ## About this Repository

Welcome to my **C Programming** repository! This collection contains various C programming exercises and projects that I practiced back in 2019. It includes fundamental to advanced C programs that helped me strengthen my understanding of core programming concepts.

### What You Will Find:
- **Basic Syntax and Operations**: Programs that cover the basic structure of C programs, data types, variables, operators, and control structures.
- **Functions**: Practice with defining and using functions, including recursive functions.
- **Pointers and Memory Management**: Extensive practice with pointers, dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `calloc`, `free`), and working with arrays using pointers.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.
- **File I/O**: Examples of reading from and writing to files using C's file handling capabilities.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, and other algorithmic exercises to solidify problem-solving skills.
- **Miscellaneous**: Various problem-solving and coding exercises that helped me refine my skills in C.

### Motivation:
I created this repository to document my C programming journey and the challenges I overcame while learning this powerful language. It serves as a reference for anyone learning C or looking for sample C programs to practice with.

Feel free to explore the code and use it for your own learning!
